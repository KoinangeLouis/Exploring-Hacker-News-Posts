# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts
In this project, we will work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. We will compare two different types of posts from Hacker News. We will be exploring two types of posts that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

It is important to note that the dataset we are working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions
